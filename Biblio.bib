abstract = {Up to now, there has been no corroboration from Cassini CIRS of the Voyager IRIS-discovery of cyanoacetylene (HC3N) ice in Titan's thermal infrared spectrum. We report the first compelling spectral evidence from CIRS for the $\nu$6HC3N ice feature at 506cm-1at latitudes 62°N and 70°N, from which we derive particle sizes and column abundances in Titan's lower stratosphere. We find mean particle radii of 3.0$\mu$m and 2.3$\mu$m for condensed HC3N at 62°N and 70°N, respectively, and corresponding ice phase molecular column abundances in the range 1-10×1016molcm-2. Only upper limits for cloud abundances can be established at latitudes of 85°N, 55°N, 30°N, 10°N, and 15°S. Under the assumption that cloud tops coincide with the uppermost levels at which HC3N vapor saturates, we infer geometric thicknesses for the clouds equivalent to 10-20km or so, with tops at 165km and 150km at 70°N and 62°N, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {We analyze observations of Titan's south polar lake Ontario Lacus obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer during the 38th flyby of Titan (T38; 2007 December 5). These near-closest-approach observations have the highest signal-to-noise, the finest spatial resolution, and the least atmospheric influence of any near-infrared lake observation to date. We use the large, spatially flat, and low-albedo interior of Ontario Lacus as a calibration target allowing us to derive an analytical atmospheric correction for emission angle. The dark lake interior is surrounded by two separate annuli that follow the lake interior's contours. The inner annulus is uniformly dark, but not so much as the interior lake, and is generally 5-10 kilometers wide at the lake's southeastern margin. We propose that it represents wet lakebed sediments exposed by either tidal sloshing of the lake or seasonal methane loss leading to lower lake-volume. The exterior annulus is bright and shows a spectrum consistent with a relatively low water-ice content relative to the rest of Titan. It may represent fine-grained condensate deposits from a past era of higher lake level. Together, the annuli seem to indicate that the lake level for Ontario Lacus has changed over time. This hypothesis can be tested with observations scheduled for future Titan flybys. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cassini/VIMS T85 observations of a solar specular reflection off of Kivu Lacus (87.°4N 241.°1E) provide an empirical transmission spectrum of Titan's atmosphere. Because this observation was acquired from short range (33,000 km), its intensity makes it visible within the 2.0, 2.7, and 2.8 $\mu$m atmospheric windows in addition to the 5 $\mu$m window where all previous specular reflections have been seen. The resulting measurement of the total one-way normal atmospheric optical depth (corresponding to haze scattering plus haze and gas absorption) provides strong empirical constraints on radiative transfer models. Using those models, we find that the total haze column abundance in our observation is 20{\%} higher than the Huygens equatorial value. Ours is the first measurement in the 2-5 $\mu$m wavelength range that probes all the way to the surface in Titan's arctic, where the vast majority of surface liquids are located. The specular technique complements other probes of atmospheric properties such as solar occultations and the direct measurements from Huygens. In breaking the degeneracy between surface and atmospheric absorptions, our measured optical depths will help to drive future calculations of deconvolved surface albedo spectra. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We use data from the VIMS instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft to construct high sensitivity and high spatial-resolution maps of the locations of tropospheric clouds on Titan in the late northern winter season during which the Cassini prime mission took place. These observations show that, in this season, clouds on Titan are strongly hemispherically asymmetric. Mid-latitude clouds, in particular, occur only in the southern hemisphere and have not ever been observed in the north. Such an asymmetry is in general agreement with circulation models where sub-solar surface heating controls the locations of clouds and appears in conflict with models where perennial polar hazes prevent significant summertime polar heating from affecting the circulation. The southern mid-latitude clouds appear to be distributed uniformly in longitude, in contrast to some previous observations. Southern high-latitude clouds exhibit a significant concentration, however, between about 180° and 270°E longitude. A spatially and temporally uniform cloud always appears northward of ∼50°N latitude. This cloud appears unchanged over the course of the observations, consistent with the interpretation that it is caused by continuous ethane condensation as air subsides and radiatively cools through the tropopause. The location of this cloud likely provides a direct tracer of elements of north polar atmospheric circulation, potentially allowing continuous monitoring of circulation changes as Titan passes through equinox into north polar spring and summer. We show that a similar analysis of this dataset by Rodriguez et al. (2009) contains substantial errors and should not be used. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We present evidence for surface deposits of solid benzene (C6H6), solid and/or liquid ethane (C2H6), or methane (CH4), and clouds of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) aerosols using diagnostic spectral features in data from the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). Cyanoacetylene (2-propynenitrile, IUPAC nomenclature, HC3N) is indicated in spectra of some bright regions, but the spectral resolution of VIMS is insufficient to make a unique identification although it is a closer match to the feature previously attributed to CO2. We identify benzene, an aromatic hydrocarbon, in larger abundances than expected by some models. Acetylene (C2H2), expected to be more abundant on Titan according to some models than benzene, is not detected. Solid acetonitrile (CH3CN) or other nitriles might be candidates for matching other spectral features in some Titan spectra. An as yet unidentified absorption at 5.01-mm indicates that yet another compound exists on Titan's surface. We place upper limits for liquid methane and ethane in some locations on Titan and find local areas consistent with millimeter path lengths. Except for potential lakes in the southern and northern polar regions, most of Titan appears "dry." Finally, we find there is little evidence for exposed water ice on the surface. Water ice, if present, must be covered with organic compounds to the depth probed by 1-5-mm photons: a few millimeters to centimeters.},

abstract = {Ontario Lacus is the largest lake of the whole southern hemisphere of Titan, Saturn's major moon. It has been imaged twice by each of the Cassini imaging systems (Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) in 2004 and 2005, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) in 2007 and 2009 and RADAR in 2009 and 2010). We compile a geomorphological map and derive a "hydrogeological" interpretation of Ontario Lacus, based on a joint analysis of ISS, VIMS and RADAR SAR datasets, along with the T49 altimetric profile acquired in December 2008. The morphologies observed on Ontario Lacus are compared to landforms of a semi-arid terrestrial analog, which resembles Titan's lakes: the Etosha Pan, located in the Owambo Basin (Namibia). The Etosha Pan is a flat-floored depression formed by dissolution, under semi-arid conditions, of a surface evaporitic layer (calcretes) controlled by groundwater vertical motions. We infer that Ontario Lacus is an extremely flat and shallow depression lying in an alluvial plain surrounded by small mountain ranges under climatic conditions similar to those of terrestrial semi-arid regions. Channels are seen in the southern part of Ontario Lacus in VIMS and RADAR data, acquired at a 2-years time interval. Their constancy in location with time implies that the southern portion of the depression is probably not fully covered by a liquid layer at the time of the observations, and that they most probably run on the floor of the depression. A shallow layer of surface liquids, corresponding to the darkest portions of the RADAR images, would thus cover about 53{\%} of the surface area of the depression, of which almost 70{\%} is located in its northern part. These liquid-covered parts of the depression, where liquid ethane was previously identified, are interpreted as topographic lows where the "alkanofer" raises above the depression floor. The rest of the depression, and mostly its southern part, is interpreted as a flat and smooth exposed floor, likely composed of a thick and liquid-saturated coating of photon-absorbing materials in the infrared. This hypothesis could explain its dark appearance both in the infrared and radar data and the persistence of channels seen on the depression floor over the time. Shorelines are observed on the border of Ontario Lacus suggesting past high-stand levels of the alkanofer table. The analogy with the Etosha Pan suggests that Ontario Lacus' depression developed at the expense of a soluble layer covering the region. Dissolution of this layer would be controlled by vertical motions of the alkanofer table over the time. During flooding events, liquid hydrocarbons covering the depression floor would dissolve the surface layer, increasing progressively the diameter of the depression on geological timescales. During drought episodes, liquid hydrocarbons of the underground alkanofer would evaporate, leading to crystallization of "evaporites" in the pores and at the surface of the substratum, and to the formation of the regional soluble layer. The presence of specific landforms (lunette dunes or evaporites) is compatible with such evaporitic regional settings. Alternatively, but not exclusively, the surface soluble layer might have formed by accumulation on the ground of soluble compounds formed in the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

These are mainly located near 220, 478, 504, 700, 760, and 816 cm−1, of which the 478 cm−1 feature has been previously identified as C4N2. Possible identifications of the five remaining features are investigated here by comparing the observations with laboratory spectra of potential ice condensate candidates: H2O, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, C3H8, C4H2, HCN, C2N2, HC3N, C4N2, CH3CN, as well as with spectra of some more complex nitriles and hydrocarbons, some of which correspond to original laboratory work. Radiative transfer calculations show that the feature observed near 220 cm−1, which could be water ice, is about a factor of 2 too narrow to be compatible with the whole signature of solid H2O. In this paper we have also performed radiative transfer calculations for solid C4N2 and HC3N (confirming the presence of the first and suggesting the latter). By comparing with laboratory data, we find that C2H2, C2H5CN, and possibly HCN and C2H6 solids, are likely candidates, while eliminating other condensed forms of photochemical products in Titan's stratosphere.},

A large cloud was observed for the first time above Titan's southern pole in May 2012, at an altitude of 300 kilometres. A temperature maximum was previously observed there, and condensation was not expected for any of Titan's atmospheric gases. Here we report that this cloud is composed of micrometre-sized particles of frozen hydrogen cyanide (HCN ice). The presence of HCN particles at this altitude, together with temperature determinations from mid-infrared observations, indicate a dramatic cooling of Titan's atmosphere inside the winter polar vortex in early 2012. Such cooling is in contrast to previously measured high-altitude warming in the polar vortex, and temperatures are a hundred degrees colder than predicted by circulation models. These results show that post-equinox cooling at the winter pole of Titan is much more efficient than previously thought.},

In the course of our work, we have found variations, such as as seasonal and diurnal effects, as well as temporary features in the southern polar region. The north-south asymmetry is shown to have changed since 2000 in the near-IR and to be currently organized in a brighter northern than southern pole. We study this evolution here. With our data, we also have new significant statistical evidence of diurnal effects in Titan's stratosphere, with a brighter (as much as 19{\%}) morning limb appearing in our images in many cases, when the phase effect is expected on the evening side. The southern bright feature is probably a time-limited seasonal and/or meteorological phenomenon, revolving around the south pole (confined in its motion within the 80◦S parallel) and located somewhere in the upper troposphere (18–40 km of altitude). Its behavior and possible nature are discussed here.},

The atmosphere is poorly understood and obscures the surface, leading to intense speculation about Titan's nature. Here we present observations of Titan from the imaging science experiment onboard the Cassini spacecraft that address some of these issues. The images reveal intricate surface albedo features that suggest aeolian, tectonic and fluvial processes; they also show a few circular features that could be impact structures. These observations imply that substantial surface modification has occurred over Titan's history. We have not directly detected liquids on the surface to date. Convective clouds are found to be common near the south pole, and the motion of mid-latitude clouds consistently indicates eastward winds, from which we infer that the troposphere is rotating faster than the surface. A detached haze at an altitude of 500 km is 150-200 km higher than that observed by Voyager, and more tenuous haze layers are also resolved.},

Subsequent images of this region of Titan show a gradual vanishing of this cloud which was reported previously. In this paper, we characterize the physical properties of this cloud, haze, and mist as well as their time evolutions. We note several details on the images such as a secondary cloud above the main cloud and latitudes beyond 70°N. We also show that the cloud disappearance leaves the polar region poorly loaded in aerosols, yielding an annular zone of aerosols between 50°N and 65°N.

abstract = {Since Saturn orbital insertion in July 2004, the Cassini orbiter has been observing Titan throughout most of the northern winter season (October 2002-August 2009) and the beginning of spring, allowing a detailed monitoring of Titan's cloud coverage at high spatial resolution with close flybys on a monthly basis. This study reports on the analysis of all the near-infrared images of Titan's clouds acquired by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) during 67 targeted flybys of Titan between July 2004 and April 2010.The VIMS observations show numerous sporadic clouds at southern high and mid-latitudes, rare clouds in the equatorial region, and reveal a long-lived cloud cap above the north pole, ubiquitous poleward of 60°N. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the cloud coverage during almost a 6-year period including the equinox, and greatly help to further constrain global circulation models (GCMs). After 4. years of regular outbursts observed by Cassini between 2004 and 2008, southern polar cloud activity started declining, and completely ceased 1. year before spring equinox. The extensive cloud system over the north pole, stable between 2004 and 2008, progressively fractionated and vanished as Titan entered into northern spring. At southern mid-latitudes, clouds were continuously observed throughout the VIMS observing period, even after equinox, in a latitude band between 30°S and 60°S. During the whole period of observation, only a dozen clouds were observed closer to the equator, though they were slightly more frequent as equinox approached. We also investigated the distribution of clouds with longitude. We found that southern polar clouds, before disappearing in mid-2008, were systematically concentrated in the leading hemisphere of Titan, in particular above and to the east of Ontario Lacus, the largest reservoir of hydrocarbons in the area. Clouds are also non-homogeneously distributed with longitude at southern mid-latitudes. The n= 2-mode wave pattern of the distribution, observed since 2003 by Earth-based telescopes and confirmed by our Cassini observations, may be attributed to Saturn's tides. Although the latitudinal distribution of clouds is now relatively well reproduced and understood by the GCMs, the non-homogeneous longitudinal distributions and the evolution of the cloud coverage with seasons still need investigation. If the observation of a few single clouds at the tropics and at northern mid-latitudes late in winter and at the start of spring cannot be further interpreted for the moment, the obvious shutdown of the cloud activity at Titan's poles provides clear signs of the onset of the general circulation turnover that is expected to accompany the beginning of Titan's northern spring. According to our GCM, the persistence of clouds at certain latitudes rather suggests a 'sudden' shift in near future of the meteorology into the more illuminated hemisphere. Finally, the observed seasonal change in cloud activity occurred with a significant time lag that is not predicted by our model. This may be due to an overall methane humidity at Titan's surface higher than previously expected. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Rodriguez2009,
abstract = {Clouds on Titan result from the condensation of methane and ethane and, as on other planets, are primarily structured by circulation of the atmosphere. At present, cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere, arising near the pole and at mid-latitudes from cumulus updrafts triggered by surface heating and/or local methane sources, and at the north (winter) pole, resulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the colder troposphere. General circulation models predict that this distribution should change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale, and that clouds should develop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes ( approximately 40 degrees ) in the winter hemisphere. The models, however, have hitherto been poorly constrained and their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified. Here we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general agreement with the models, confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled by the global circulation. The non-detection of clouds at latitude approximately 40 degrees N and the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending are, however, both contrary to predictions. This suggests that Titan's equator-to-pole thermal contrast is overestimated in the models and that its atmosphere responds to the seasonal forcing with a greater inertia than expected.},

This short timescale has led to the suggestion that Titan may possess a surface or subsurface reservoir of hydrocarbons to replenish the atmosphere. Here we report near-infrared images of Titan obtained on 26 October 2004 by the Cassini spacecraft. The images show that a widespread methane ocean does not exist; subtle albedo variations instead suggest topographical variations, as would be expected for a more solid (perhaps icy) surface. We also find a circular structure approximately 30 km in diameter that does not resemble any features seen on other icy satellites. We propose that the structure is a dome formed by upwelling icy plumes that release methane into Titan's atmosphere.},

abstract = {Since Titan entered Northern spring in August 2009, the North Pole has been illuminated allowing observations at optical wavelengths. On June 5, 2010 the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft observed the Northern Pole area with a pixel size from 3 to 7km. Since, as we demonstrate, little of the solar flux at 5$\mu$m is scattered by the atmosphere, these observations were obtained at relatively large incidence angles and allowed us to build a mosaic covering an area of more than 500,000km 2 that overlaps and complements observations made by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in 2007. We find that there is an excellent correlation between the shape of the radar dark area, known as Ligeia Mare and the VIMS 5-$\mu$m dark unit. Matching most of the radar shoreline, the 2010 VIMS observations suggest that the 125,000-km 2 surface area of Ligeia Mare measured by RADAR in 2007 has not significantly changed. The VIMS observations complement the radar observations to the west of Ligeia Mare and suggest that Ligeia Mare is connected to Kraken Mare by either a diffuse network similar to a swamp area, or by well-defined, sub-pixel rivers. Considering the results of recent evaporation models of methane, our preferred interpretation of the relative constancy in surface area of Ligeia is that it is principally composed of ethane although we cannot rule out the possibility that methane evaporation is balanced with replenishment by either precipitation or underground seepage. There is also strong correlation between the location of the small radar lakes and the small VIMS 5-$\mu$m dark patches. The geographic location of the small lakes are within a VIMS pixel of the SAR location, suggesting that the non-synchronous component of Titan's spin rate, if it exists, was less than 2.3×10 -4deg/day between 2007 and 2010 in agreement with the recent T64 radar observations. These observations question the existence of non-synchronous rotation. Two radar-bright features appear dark at 5-$\mu$m. The simplest interpretation is that these are very shallow lakes, less than one meter deep. Three new small lakes, named Freeman, Cardiel, and Towada by the IAU, are found outside of the area mapped with the SAR. A single-scattering model describing reflection of sunlight at 5-$\mu$m suggests that the lake surface is mirror-like and that the albedo of the solid surfaces surrounding the lakes is about 8{\%}. These observations together with information of the haze aerosols allow us to show that Titan's lakes, atmospheric ethane and aerosol haze are smaller carbon reservoirs than Titan's sand dunes and atmospheric methane. A simple model involving an outburst of methane a few hundreds of Myr ago followed by the dissociation of methane in the atmosphere leading to the formation of the haze particles that constitute the dune fields would be consistent with both the present observations and recent measurements of isotopic ratios in atmospheric methane (Mandt, K.E. et al.

Throughout 2010-2011, strengthening subsidence produced a mesospheric hot-spot and caused extreme enrichment of photochemically produced trace gases. However, in 2012 unexpected and rapid mesospheric cooling was observed. Here we show extreme trace gas enrichment within the polar vortex dramatically increases mesospheric long-wave radiative cooling efficiency, causing unusually cold temperatures 2-6 years post-equinox. The long time-frame to reach a stable vortex configuration results from the high infrared opacity of Titan's trace gases and the relatively long atmospheric radiative time constant. Winter polar hot-spots have been observed on other planets, but detection of post-equinox cooling is so far unique to Titan.},

abstract = {This paper is about the seasonal changes captured by Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). Here, the authors discussed the very first indication of seasonal change by studying the movements of methane cloud over a quarter of a Titan year (1 Titan year is about 29.5 Earth years). It reported that cloud presence at the southern polar region became sparse while northern polar region had clouds forming observed in 2009. However, the complete picture was not clear yet because it required more time to study cloud movements. Notwithstanding, it is apparent that some sort of mechanisms were need to allow the clouds to form in northern latitudes. An indication of the influence polar seas was more or less clear because of the presence norther latitude clouds near lakes and polar seas.},

@article{Turtle2009,
abstract = {Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has been observing Titan since April 2004, compiling a nearly global surface map and monitoring the surface and atmosphere for activity. Early images of the south-polar region revealed numerous dark surface features and contemporaneous convective cloud systems, suggesting the presence of hydrocarbon lakes similar to those later detected at Titan's North Pole. Intriguingly, repeated south-polar imaging by ISS revealed differences consistent with ponding of hydrocarbon liquids on the surface due to precipitation from a large storm. More recent ISS images of high northern latitudes illustrate the full extents ({\textgreater} 500,000 km(2)) of hydrocarbon seas, sections of which have been observed by Cassini's RADAR. These observations demonstrate dynamic processes at work on Titan and that the poles harbor liquid-hydrocarbon reservoirs, the extents of which differ from pole to pole and which may be coupled to seasonally varying circulation.
